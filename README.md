Hello friends, welcome to this repository. I have explained three things here in the [Youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL41E9cd-QxQ7WFn3eWcnnrbWCGmKWQCFV)...

* How to setup the Elasticsearch using docker see the [video.](https://youtu.be/fc4oESsk_Sw)

* How to interact with the ES engine using simple cUrl requests from Postman see the [video.](https://youtu.be/AW7CcvJePN8)

* Setup a Python + Flask API to interact with the Elasticsearch engine see the [video.](https://youtu.be/qnQNf6HtZAI)

You will find following things here in the repository...

* in the folder engine, there is a docker-compose.yml file

* in the folder postman, you will find the Postman collection I have used, you can import that in your Postman application

* in the python folder, there is a project_code folder which contains the sample Python + Flask code.

### Note:

There are also some supportive documents to help you in other tasks as well.

##### Enjoy the life, feel the music.
